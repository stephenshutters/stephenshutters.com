								<p>
								    On August 26th, 2020, I posed a question to my friends on Facebook and
										my followers on Twitter. Admittedly, it was a fairly loaded question. It was
										a question that I believe, when taken seriously, not-unduly challenges the
										long-held beliefs of us 21st century western evangelical protestant Christians.
										My Facebook post and the multiple responses it received are pictured to the
										left. Yep, I know. That's a lot. If you're reading this on a small screen,
										feel free to zoom in on the Facebook discussion and establish some context
										for my following response, or feel free to just ignore that screenshot and
										jump in here headfirst. The question:
								</p>
								<blockquote><p>
									If Yeshua paid our debt by physically dying and not by spending an eternity
									in conscious torment, why would we think our debt is an eternity in conscious
									torment?
								</p></blockquote>
								<p>
								    Rather than splitting this conversation into multiple comment threads by
								    responding to each person’s comments directly beneath their own, I am
								    attempting here to respond to as many comments as I can in one succinct
								    essay form. My hope is that this will keep others from re-asking questions
								    others have asked or making points that have already been made and also
								    prevent me from having to respond to the same questions and comments
								    multiple times. This is because I only have a limited amount of time in my
								    life and am selfish with it. Haha.
								</p>
								<p>
								    Also, before I get into the weeds with you all on this topic, I’d like to
								    point out that I have zero qualms whatsoever with the ethics of the
								    traditional view of Hell. I’ve believed in it for 24 years without issue,
								    because YHWH is God and can do whatever the hell He wants. I don’t believe
								    the traditional view of eternal conscious torment is unjust in any way; the
								    Creator has every right to deal with His creations in any way He sees fit.
								    Rather, the questions I have posed above have arisen not from any sort of
								    trouble with perceived justice or ethics but from what seems to me and many
								    other followers of Christ&mdash;both now and even as far back as the writings of
								    Clement of Rome (AD 30-97), Ignatius of Antioch (AD 35-107), Polycarp of
								    Smyrna (AD 69-155), Papias of Hierapolis (AD 70-163), Quadratus of Athens
								    (c. AD 126), Mathetes (c. AD 130), Clement of Corinth (c. AD 130), Barnabas
								    of Alexandria (c. AD 135), Aristides of Athens (c. AD 140), Justin of
								    Samaria (AD 106-165), Theophilus of Antioch (AD 115-181), Athenagoras of
								    Athens (AD 127-190), Polycrates of Ephesus (AD 125-196), Irenaeus of Lyons
								    (AD 130-202), Clement of Alexandria (AD 153-213), Tertullian of Carthage
								    (AD 145-220), Hippolytus of Portus Romanus (AD 170-236), Minucius Felix of
								    Africa (AD 185-250), Origen of Alexandria (AD 185-254), Commodianus of
								    Africa (AD 200-275), Cyprian of Carthage (AD 200-258), Novatian of Rome (AD
								    210-280), Gregory Thaumaturgus of Neo-Caesarea (AD 213-270), and Arnobius
								    of Sicca (AD 250-327)&mdash;to be inconsistencies with the rest of Scripture. I
								    am a definite proponent of tota scriptura (the belief that the context of
								    the entire Bible must be taken into account for every claim and that
								    cherry-picking verses is unwise), and it seems that the concept of eternal
								    conscious torment is actually quite out of sync with the teachings of the
								    Bible as a whole. I want to know what the Bible says more than what sounds
								    pleasant or is even most popularly believed within any culture at any time.
								    Goodness, this has been a long introduction! But I hope it clears up my
								    intentions and removes from our discussion the potential issue of “You just
								    need to lean not on your own understandings; trust what God says.” That is
								    exactly what I am seeking to do.
								</p>
								<p>
								    First, I’ll respond to your claim, Aunt Jeannie, that “it certainly appears
								    pretty clear in Scripture that [eternal conscious torment] is what is
								    taught.” Interestingly enough, this traditional view of Hell did not become
								    a standard within the church until after Augustine wrote <em>City of God</em> in
								    around AD 410, in which he was the first Christian theologian to write a
								    systematic defense of the view. For the nearly 400 years of Christianity
								    prior to Augustine’s writings on the subject, the Church was actually
								    pretty divided on it as can be seen by the several theologians I noted
								    above from the first 300 years of the Christian movement. The first nine
								    theologians I listed were actually around while the Apostles were still
								    alive (the Apostle John didn’t die until AD 102). That fact in conjunction
								    with the fact that the Church was divided on the issue for nearly 400 years
								    suggests to me that, at the very least, the issue may not be so clearly
								    taught and understood as many today often think. To go even further,
								    however, I would argue that Scripture appears to more clearly and
								    consistently teach the view known as conditional immortality (also known
								    more reductively as annihilationism) than it does the view of eternal
								    conscious torment.
								</p>
								<p>
								    Second, I’ll respond to your claim, Aunt Jeannie, that “Death in Scripture
								    speaks of separation&mdash;like when God told Adam if he ate of that fruit, he
								    would surely die that day&mdash;not physically, but spiritually.” You are correct
								    that Genesis 2:17 says “. . . for in the day that you eat from it you will
								    certainly die.” But the death mentioned here is a literal and physical
								    death. The very word used here and in Genesis 3:3-4 for death is used in a
								    literal and physical sense all other 79 times it is used in the book of
								    Genesis and is even used to refer to the deaths of animals (and I’ve never
								    heard of an animal experiencing spiritual death). In addition to all the
								    times in Genesis when the word “death” refers to a physical bodily death,
								    the New Testament also uses the word in the same way many times. A partial
								    list of examples being Matthew 10:21; 15:4; 20:18; 26:66; Luke 2:26; 22:33;
								    23:15; 23:22; John 11:13; 21:19; Acts 13:28; 23:29; 25:11; 26:31; 28:18;
								    Romans 8:38 (which is a really fun one that says death cannot separate us
								    from God); Philippians 1:20; 2:27; Hebrews 7:23; 9:16; Revelation 2:10;
								    9:6; and 12:11. Now, the reason people take this phrase in Genesis 2:17 to
								    mean a spiritual death rather than a physical one is that Adam and Eve did
								    not actually physically die that day. However, this is a misunderstanding
								    of the Hebrew idiom “in the day” and the special function of “certainly
								    die,” which, along with attention to context, must inform our reading of
								    the English translation. We must be wary of imposing our modern cultural
								    assumptions upon these ancient Hebrew phrases. As Walter Kaiser states in
								    his book entitled </em>Hard Sayings of the Bible</em>:
								</p>
								<blockquote><p>
								    “It is just as naïve to insist that the phrase ‘in the day’ means that on
								    that very day death would occur. A little knowledge of the Hebrew idiom
								    will relieve the tension here as well. For example, in 1 Kings 2:37 King
								    Solomon warned a seditious Shimei, ‘The day you leave [Jerusalem] and cross
								    the Kidron Valley [which is immediately outside the city walls on the east
								    side of the city], you can be sure you will die.’ Neither the 1 Kings nor
								    the Genesis text implies <em>immediacy of action</em> on that very same
										day; instead they point to the <em>certainty of the predicted consequence</em>
										that would be set in motion by the act initiated on that day. Alternate wordings
										include ‘at the time when,’ ‘at that time,’ ‘now when,’ and
										‘the day [when]’ (see Gen. 5:1; Ex. 6:28; 10:28; 32:34).”
								</p></blockquote>

								<p>
								    In other words, the warning “you will certainly die” became instantly true
								    in the form of a death sentence, conviction, or curse. It could actually be
								    better understood as “you will be doomed to die.” In Hebrew, the phrase
								    “you will certainly die” (<strong>מֹות תָּמֽוּת</strong>) is what’s known
								    as an infinitive absolute, which has no exact English equivalent. It’s less
								    about when death occurs and more about when the certainty of death is
								    incurred. To confirm that modern Hebrew scholars have correctly understood
								    the ancient nuances behind “in the day that you eat from it you will
								    certainly die,” we can take a look at the Targum Jonathan (a second century
								    Aramaic translation of the Torah), in which Genesis 2:17 reads, “in the day
								    that thou eatest thou wilt be <em>guilty</em> of death.” This is also
								    corroborated by other well-known experts on ancient Hebrew such as Robert
								    Alter and John Walton. Alter states:
								</p>
								<blockquote><p>
								    “The form of the Hebrew in both instances is what grammarians call the
								    infinitive absolute: the infinitive immediately followed by a conjugated
								    form of the same verb. The general effect of this repetition is to add
								    emphasis to the verb, but because in the case of the verb ‘to die’ it is
								    the pattern regularly used in the Bible for the issuing of death sentences,
								    ‘doomed to die’ is an appropriate equivalent.”
								</p></blockquote>

								<p>
								    And Walton affirms:
								</p>
								<blockquote><p>
								    “The KJV, NKJV, and NASB all translate ‘in the day’ you eat from it. The
								    NIV has replaced this with the appropriate English rendering ‘when.’ The
								    expression ‘in the day’ is one of the major ways in Hebrew to say ‘when’
								    and does not suggest that the events described will take place within the
								    next twenty-four hours, though, as Wenham maintains, its use implies
								    promptness. More important, the verbal combination that describes the
								    penalty (‘you will surely die’) needs clarification. The profile of this
								    combination of verb forms (infinitive absolute coupled with finite verb of
								    the same root) using the root ‘to die’ can be established with a good deal
								    of confidence. In Jeremiah 26, the prophet delivers a scathing message to
								    the people of Judah to the effect that the temple will be destroyed
								    (26:4–6). The response of the people and priests is not repentance but
								    antagonism toward Jeremiah as they seize him and pass sentence: ‘You must
								    die!’ (26:8). The explanation is given a few verses later, ‘This man should
								    be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city’ (26:11).
								    Jeremiah 26:8 uses the same phrase as we have in Genesis 2:17, but it is
								    Jeremiah 26:11 that shows us exactly what the people mean by using that
								    phrase in verse 8. When they say, ‘You will surely die,’ they are talking
								    about the eventual outcome of the behavior. The sentence will be passed,
								    the doom will be fixed. This phrase is also used in the historical
								    literature to pass sentence on offenders of various kinds (Gen. 20:7; Num.
								    26:65; 1 Sam. 14:39, 44; 1 Kings 2:37, 42). The resulting paraphrase of
								    Genesis 2:17 then is: ‘When you eat of it, you will be sentenced to death
								    and therefore doomed to die.’ Consequently, death will be a certainty.”
								</p></blockquote>

								<p>
								    He adds:
								</p>
								<blockquote><p>
								    “The significance of this has some impact on theology. The theological
								    logic that has been applied to this text in the past is that since Adam and
								    Eve did not drop over dead on the first bite of the forbidden fruit or die
								    shortly thereafter (‘that day’), the warning from God must have referred to
								    spiritual death. This is an excellent example of how exegetical
								    shortsightedness can result in unwarranted theological conclusions. There
								    is no reason to dispute the concept of spiritual death or to question that
								    Adam and Eve’s sin eventuated in that condition. It is a mistake, however,
								    to deduce that the warning of 2:17 had spiritual death in mind because
								    physical death did not occur right away. In actual fact, the language of
								    the threatened penalty did not imply that physical death would immediately
								    ensue. This penalty was enacted when they were driven out of the garden and
								    prevented access to the tree of life. Without such access, they were doomed
								    to die.”
								</p></blockquote>

								<p>
								    Simply put, before Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge
								    of good and bad, they would live forever, but after they ate from that
								    tree, they were then doomed to die. This is further demonstrated by YHWH’s
								    words and actions in Genesis 3:22-24, which says, “The Lord God said,
								    ‘Since the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil, he must
								    not reach out, take from the tree of life, eat, and live forever.’ So the
								    Lord God sent him away from the garden of Eden to work the ground from
								    which he was taken. He drove the man out and stationed the cherubim and the
								    flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the
								    tree of life.”
								</p>
								<p>
								    Third, I’ll respond, Aunt Jeannie, to your book suggestion. <em>Erasing Hell</em>
								    was written by Preston Sprinkle and Francis Chan in 2011. Since the book’s
								    publication, Sprinkle has abandoned the eternal conscious torment view in
								    favor of conditional immortality. He has said on Twitter, “Conditionalism
								    (aka annihilation) is among the clearest biblical doctrines that I’ve
								    encountered in my 24 years of studying the Bible, supported by hundreds of
								    texts and only challenged by 1 or 2 that could, in themselves, be taken to
								    support ECT.” You can hear him tell the story of the change in his
								interpretation of Scripture <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRI_poLkOms">here</a>. In addition
								    to Sprinkle's adoption of conditional immortality, <em>Erasing Hell</em> even says
								    on page 86, “The debate about hell’s duration is much more complex than I
								    first assumed. While I lean heavily on the side that says it is
								    everlasting, I am not ready to claim that with complete certainty. I
								    encourage you to continue researching&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
								</p>
								<p>
								    Fourth, I’ll respond to your syllogism, Kevin. I don’t at all disagree with
								    you that Yeshua “was uniquely qualified to pay for eternal punishment.” I
								    believe that He, in fact, <em>did</em> pay for eternal punishment&mdash;that
								    punishment being an eternal physical death. What the Bible tells us is not
								    just that Yeshua paid for our punishment, but more specifically that He
								    took our specific punishment upon Himself. We call this penal
								    substitutionary atonement. Romans 6:23 tells us that “the wages of sin is
								    death.” And as J.I. Packer puts it, “With the other New Testament writers,
								    Paul always points to the death of Jesus as the atoning event, and explains
								    the atonement in terms of representative substitution&mdash;the innocent taking
								    the place of the guilty, in the name and for the sake of the guilty, under
								    the axe of God’s judicial retribution.” I’ve always been taught that Christ
								    suffered the punishment that was meant for us, and that means that either
								    our deserved punishment was an eternity of flames devouring our flesh and
								    Christ suffered (and still is suffering) that or our deserved punishment
								    was death (as the Bible tells us) and Christ suffered that death (as the
								    Bible also tells us). The great news is that He not only took our death for
								    us, but He also rose again from the dead!
